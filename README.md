This project was made for the Alchemy Weekly Challenge.

The technologies that i used for this project was ReactJS + NextJS + Tailwincss, and also use the Alchemy API, this allows me to fetch data directly from the blockchain using HTTPs request.

The web is fully functional, but i haven't fully finished the style and the UI.
